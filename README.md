  ## 1. Description

  ## 2. Installation

 Once you have the repo copied, run npm install in the terminal, and then npm start. Once that's done you can access localhost 3001 on your browser, and use an offline version of the app. You can also test routes with middleware.
 It may be fun to do things your own way, but I would reccomend checking out the deployed app here: https://boiling-refuge-17872.herokuapp.com/notes
